HaskellGravityWorld
===================

This is a simple gravity simulation written in Haskell. I did it just
for fun and to learn Haskell, so it should not be taken too seriously,
but feel free to extend and improve it! Some code in this repository
is taken from Mikael Johanssons' excellent
[Haskell OpenGL Tutorial](http://blog.mikael.johanssons.org/archive/2006/09/opengl-programming-in-haskell-a-tutorial-part-1/).

## Compilation ##

1. Install [cabal](http://www.haskell.org/cabal/) 
2. Run `cabal install` (Will download dependencies and compile
   executable)
